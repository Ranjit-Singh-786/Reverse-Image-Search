# Reverse-Image-Search
### Description
i build a Database to perform this project, in this project when you will upload your image in this software. it will return 5  similar  images which will be absolutely similar item of image.
 to perform this task. first my CNN model will extract the feature from the client image. and then machine learning model will search the similar image from the Database. and finally it will return the 5 similar image. which will be absolutely similar item of image. by shape, by color everything. but all are images different to the client image.

 e.g if user upload the red color sport shoes image. then my project will find out the similar color and similar design of image from the database. and in the last it will return 5 similar images as a prediction.

### ''' in this project i used custom learning '''
### To complete this project
#### i used ResNet50 CNN algorithm and NearestNeighbors ML algorithm
#### and cosine similarity. to get the similar image.

### to install all the dependencies
''' pip install -r requirements.txt '''
### to run the file 
''' python app.py '''
### steps to run this project
<ul>
<li>clone this Repository.</li>
<li>intall the dependencies.</li>
<li>Run the app.py file</li>
</ul>
